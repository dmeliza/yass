Runs on Linux, OS X, and probably any other POSIX-compliant system.  Requirements:

* X11
* Xft
* JACK (version 1 or 2)

To install:

1. cd to this directory,
2. run make
3. run make install (as root).

By default yass will be installed in /usr/bin. To change this, modify the PREFIX
variable in the Makefile.
