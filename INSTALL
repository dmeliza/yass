To install, cd to this directory,  make,
make install (as root). 

You need the shared libraries:

  libclthreads.so.2.2.0
  libclxclient.so.3.3.1
 
and the corresponding header files installed. These are available at
<http://users.skynet.be/solaris/linuxaudio>. 

By default yass will be installed in /usr/bin. To change this,
modify the PREFIX variable in the Makefile.
